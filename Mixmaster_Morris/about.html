			<h1>ABOUT MORRIS</h1>
			</header>
			<p>
			Morris Gould was born in Brighton, grew up in Lincolnshire and was educated at Millfield School, Somerset and King's College, London.</p>
			<p>
			He started Djing in the 1980s at indie gigs, then on pirate radio/tv station Network 21, earning the nickname "Mixmaster Morris". He opened his first club, The Gift, in New Cross in 1985, and in 1987 began releasing material as Irresistible Force, initially in collaboration with singer-songwriter Des de Moor.</p>
			<p>
			A show with the band Psychic TV led to him becoming full-time DJ with The Shamen, and touring with them on their Synergy tour for nearly two years. He then signed with Rising High Records for the albums Flying High and Global Chillage, later joining up with Pete Namlook to record two albums as Dreamfish and recording two sessions for BBC's John Peel.</p>
			<p>
			In the early 1990s his key residencies were alongside the Detroit masters at Lost, Megatripolis at London's Heaven, and also the Tribal Gathering parties. He remixed Coldcut's Autumn Leaves which went on to become a classic, and his mix for INXS was a top 20 hit in the UK. He was a regular at Love Parade, Berlin, and the Glastonbury festival throughout the 1990s. He has been involved with the Big Chill since its inception in 1994 and has played there every year since then.</p>
			<p>
			He has toured Europe, the USA and Japan repeatedly, and made mix CDs like The Morning After, Abstract Funk Theory, and God Bless The Chilled. In 1998 he signed with Ninja Tunes and made the album Its Tomorrow Already and the singles Nepalese Bliss and Fish Dances. He also recorded an album, Quiet Logic, in Japan with Jonah Sharp and Harry Hosono of YMO.</p>
			<p>
			Morris has written articles for NME, Mixmag and i-D magazine, presented The Chill Out Zone on Kiss FM, and remixed the Dr Who theme for the BBC. He made his film debut in Modulations (Caipirinha Films), and his music has been used in a number of other films including Groove and Hey Happy. </p>
			<p>
			In 2009 he compiled a podcast for the Tate Britain to accompany their Altermodern exhibition, and opened a new AV night called MMMTV in Camden. The mix CD, Calm Down My Selector, was released in January by Wakyo Records, and he made a tour of Japan to promote it.</p>
			<p>
			Mixmaster Morris has won Ibiza Chillout DJ of the year three times, and appeared in many lists of the worlds top DJ's including Ministry of Sound's book, The Annual, 2003's DJs by Lopez, and URB Magazine's Top 100 DJ list. </p>
			<p>
			In 2010 he was announced Head of A&R for Apollo Records, and 2011 saw him join Bestival as part of their Ambient Forest team.
